# Computer-Vision
### Canny
- Implements the Canny edge detection algorithm.  
- Run ``` ./Canny easy.jpg ``` in the terminal in the project folder to view results.
### Coins
- Implements a Canny edge detector, Gaussian blur, Sobel operator, and a Hough transform to identify
and count the value of coins on a table.
- Run ``` ./Coins easy.jpg ``` in the terminal in the project folder to view results
### DisplayImage
- Quick project to display an image in a window.
- Run ``` ./DisplayImage waterbear.jpg ``` in the terminal in the project folder to view results.  
### CoinsOpenCV
- Implements Coins project with a heavier emphasis on OpenCV
- Run ``` ./CoinsOpenCV easy.jpg ``` in the terminal in the project folder to view results
### Triangle
- Implements Bresenham's algorithm to draw a circle inscribed in a randomly generated triangle inside a circle
- Open triangle.ppm to view example
- Run ``` ./Triangle ``` in the terminal in the project folder to generate a new pixel drawing 
### Closest_Pair
- Implements an algorithm to find the closest pair of points in a plane with many points.
- Run ``` ./Closest_Pair ``` in the terminal in the project folder to run an example of the N log N vs. N<sup>2</sup> algorithm
- N log N algorithm will run in a plane with between 100,000 and 1,000,000 points and the N<sup>2</sup> algorithm
will run in a plane with between 5000 and 50,000 points
- Both algorithms will report results and time data to display N log N speedup
- closest.ppm is a graphic representation of the closest pair of points in a plane with randomly generated points  
### VideoAnalysis
- Renders a cube in 3D perspective on the chessboard shown in the video when the camera's view
of the chessboard is unblocked.
- Run ``` ./VideoAnalysis withChessBoard.MOV ``` in the terminal in the project folder to view the video with a 3D rendered cube inserted into the frames
